## Meerkat

***Meerkat***, Yodlee's Data Exploration and Enrichment Platform, blends a host of technologies into a powerful web service that allows us to predict various attributes of a financial transaction.  These attributes include
* Geolocation (e.g. Street Address, City, State, Latitude and Longitude)
* Name of merchant (e.g. Kroger, Target, CVS, McDonald's)
* Type of transaction (e.g. Spend, Payroll, Refund, Fee)
